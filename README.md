**DiscordUtils** is a *lightweight*, *discord utility minecraft plugin*, designed to help every server owner *connect* the players with **his discord server**.

---

## ⚙️ Features
 - **Fully configurable GUI**, with info items and more!
 - **Custom block** for the *discord-item* in the GUI
 - Fully configurable **sounds**
 - Multiple ways of **displaying the discord link to the player**
 - Toggleable mini **fetching-data** feature
 - **Simple configuration**  
And **more**! Check `config.yml` for every feature!  

🔴 **DiscordUtils** works best with a *PAPER server*, because it uses some stuff which work **ONLY** on it.
